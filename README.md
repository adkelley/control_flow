## Exercises

* Practice using `prompt`, `confirm`, and `alert` try the following. You may want to look them up on **MDN**.
  * Ask the user for the their `firstName`. Then `alert` it.
  * Ask the `user` `"have we met before?"`. If `true` then respond `"nice to meet you"`.
* Get the temperature from the user and alert it back in Celsius.
* Confirm if a user has three friends? Use a loop and `prompt` to collect the names of the `friends`. Alert back the names of the `friends`.
* Prompt the user to give a word. Then alert back the number of vowels.
* Write a loop to solve the following riddle. I am a number between `2` and `100`. I am even and multiple of 3. I end in `2`. My digits sum to `9`.
* Generate a random number between 1 and 100, an integer not a float. Prompt the user to guess the number. Continue prompting the user for a guess using a loop, telling them each time if the number is lower or higher.
* Super Challenge: Given an array of friends

  ```
  var friends = [
                  "larry",
                  "moe",
                  "curly",
                  "huey",
                  "louie",
                  "dewey"
                  ].
  ```

  write a loop to alert them in some random order.
